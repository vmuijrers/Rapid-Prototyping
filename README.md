# Rapid-Prototyping

Welcome to the rapid prototyping page, here you will find some useful scripts to use in your project, go to Assets -> 01_Scripts and check out some of the generic scripts including:
- EventManager - Can be used to send messages from one class to another without the two classes knowing about each other
- AudioManager - Easy to use audio class
- Utility - A handy extneions class with some static functions like Remap, Sign, Shuffle and GetObjectInRange
- StateMachine - Use the state machine to run states on your Enemies for example
- Singleton - Inherit from this class to turn your class into an easily accessible Singleton
- TimerManager - Use this class to run timers (it works like an alarm, if the time runs out, something happens)
- InputManager - Can be easily changed to use throughout your project, allows simulated button presses
